To streamline development processes and ensure\n                consistency, I joined a small but mighty design team to build and develop the framework with the\n                goal of empowering our teams to develop these new products in an accessible and user-friendly\n                way.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Our company, serving numerous industries including commercial, government, and\n                transportation, faced significant challenges with inconsistent design practices across different\n                teams. This led to inefficient processes and fragmented user experiences. Our division was\n                tasked with creating a new platform built on new technology to enable engineers to deliver\n                low-code solutions for various customer needs. To address these issues, our design team set out\n                to build a design system to support the quick growth of our new enterprise-level product.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Objectives</h2>\n            <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\">\n                <li>Establish a consistent design language across these products.</li>\n                <li>Improve collaboration between designers and developers working across global time zones.\n                </li>\n                <li>Enhance efficiency by reducing redundant work.</li>\n                <li>Ensure accessibility standards are met across all components.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <h2>My Contributions</h2>\n            <p>\n                My work spanned nearly all aspects of the design system. I began with UI audits of\n                initial designs and code, then built components in XD before migrating and rebuilding them in\n                Figma. I also wrote our foundational CSS, established design standards & front-end guidelines,\n                and ensured the continued maintenance, evangelism, and success of the design system.\n            </p>\n        </article>\n        <article x-show=\"activeTab === 2\" role=\"tabpanel\" tabindex=\"0\" id=\"tabpanel-2\" aria-labelledby=\"tab-2\">\n            <h2>Audit and Discovery:</h2>\n            <p>Just before I joined the team, our design lead had created a few early screens in Adobe XD to produce some main views during the development of an MVP. These designs formed the basis of our design system's foundational styles and components. During this phase, I worked closely with our development teams to understand the frameworks already in place. I used this information to build out our grid system within XD and document any component outliers for future implementation.</p>\n            <h2>Design and Development:</h2>\n            <p>Initially, we used Adobe XD for creating a shared library of styles and components. However, as our design library grew, we switched to Figma due to XD's limitations. I recreated our foundational styles and components in Figma and drove our documentation efforts using OneNote, which was already adopted across our organization. Links to documentation were included on component pages and vice-versa.In tandem with design efforts, I translated our foundational styles into a base Sass file and created initial documentation for our development teams. I worked closely with our UI development team to integrate our components into Storybook and set up workflows in Azure DevOps that incorporated automated testing for code consistency and accessibility.</p>\n            <h2>Challenges</h2>\n            <p>One major challenge was dealing with conflicts from other UI libraries that development teams had used to build initial views. These libraries caused issues with styling specificity. While I lobbied for stripping out the competing libraries, we had to manage with existing resources, creating a new epic in our backlog for future improvements.With our team spread across the globe, coordinating discussions was challenging. I often shared recordings of myself explaining my thought processes to allow design and development to continue during my offline hours. This approach was much appreciated by my colleagues and facilitated continuous progress.</p>\n            <h2>Outcomes</h2>\n            <p>The design system's creation in tandem with new view designs in Figma ensured seamless adoption. Constant communication between our design and development teams resulted in consistent and accessible implementation. Our efforts received high praise from other dev teams, product managers, and stakeholders for the high quality and ease of incorporating the design system's components into our products.</p>\n            <h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n            <p>Creating a successful design system requires buy-in from leadership, passionate and communicative teams, and a product-like approach. Proper planning, constant communication, purposeful inclusion, ample documentation, and ongoing maintenance are key to widespread adoption and continued relevance.</p>\n            <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n            <p>Despite initial reliance on other UI libraries, close collaboration with the design system team transformed our development processes. This led to more efficient workflows and a cohesively tailored user experience, ultimately enhancing our product offerings.</p>\n            <div class=\"not-prose\">\n                <figure class=\"mt-16\">\n                    <figcaption class=\"mb-4 text-base\">Sketching more than just UI flows, I often start my design thoughts on paper.

The opportunity to take full ownership of the design process was a challenge I was eager to tackle. From research and ideation to prototyping and implementation, I was responsible for every stage of product design.</p>\n\n<h2>Challenges and Growth:</h2>\n<p>Working solo meant balancing a wide array of tasks. I had to be not just a designer, but also a researcher, strategist, and sometimes even a project manager. This role pushed me to quickly adapt and learn, ensuring that I could handle the full spectrum of design responsibilities. The autonomy allowed me to refine my decision-making skills and become more resourceful, especially when navigating tight deadlines or complex projects.</p>\n\n<h2>Design Process:</h2> <p>My design process was user-centric and iterative. I began with thorough research, conducting user interviews and analyzing feedback to understand pain points and needs. I used these insights to inform my ideation phase, where I created wireframes and user flows using [Design Tools]. Prototyping was an integral part of my process, allowing me to test and refine designs before final implementation. Collaboration with the development team was crucial to ensure that the designs were translated effectively into the final product.</p>\n\n<h2>Collaboration:</h2> <p>As the only designer, effective communication with other departments was crucial. I regularly collaborated with developers to ensure the feasibility of my designs, and I worked closely with marketing to align the product's design with the brand's voice. I also took the initiative to organize design reviews with stakeholders to gather feedback early and often, which helped in aligning the design with business objectives.</p>\n\n<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2> <p>This experience taught me the importance of flexibility and adaptability. I learned to manage my time effectively, prioritize tasks, and maintain a clear focus on user needs while balancing business goals. The role also strengthened my problem-solving skills, as I often had to find creative solutions to complex design challenges.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2> My time at FM:Systems was incredibly rewarding. As the sole UX/Product Designer, I was able to drive significant design improvements that positively impacted the company's products and user experience. This role not only deepened my design expertise but also prepared me for future challenges in the ever-evolving field of UX and Product Design.</p>\n        </article>\n        <article x-show=\"activeTab === 2\" role=\"tabpanel\" tabindex=\"0\" id=\"tabpanel-2\" aria-labelledby=\"tab-2\">\n\n<h2>Key Projects:</h2> <p>One of the most significant projects I worked on was [Project Name]. The goal was to [brief description of the project's goal]. I led the design from the initial concept to the final implementation, resulting in [specific outcome, e.g., a 20% increase in user engagement]. This project was a testament to the impact of a well-executed design strategy, and it showcased the value of user-centered design in achieving business goals.</p>\n        </article>\n    </div>\n\n</div>",
