The opportunity to take full ownership of the design process was a challenge I was eager to tackle. From research and ideation to prototyping and implementation, I was responsible for every stage of product design.</p>\n            <h2>Challenges and Growth:</h2>\n            <p>Working solo meant balancing a wide array of tasks. I had to be not just a designer, but also a researcher, strategist, and sometimes even a project manager. This role pushed me to quickly adapt and learn, ensuring that I could handle the full spectrum of design responsibilities. The autonomy allowed me to refine my decision-making skills and become more resourceful, especially when navigating legacy products and multiple platforms.</p>\n            <h2>Design Process:</h2>\n            <p>My design process was user-centric and iterative. I began with thorough research, conducting user interviews and analyzing feedback to understand pain points and needs. I used these insights to inform my ideation phase, where I created wireframes and user flows using Sketch and Adobe XD. Prototyping was an integral part of my process, allowing me to test and refine designs before final implementation. Collaboration with the development teams was crucial to ensure that the designs were translated effectively into the final products.</p>\n            <h2>Collaboration:</h2>\n            <p>As the only designer, effective communication with other departments was crucial. I regularly collaborated with developers to ensure the feasibility of my designs, and I worked closely with product management to align the product's design with our north star.</p>\n            <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>\n            <p>This experience taught me the importance of flexibility and adaptability. I learned to manage my time effectively, prioritize tasks, and maintain a clear focus on user needs while balancing business goals. The role also strengthened my problem-solving skills, as I often had to find creative solutions to complex design challenges.</p>\n            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n            <p>My time at FM:Systems was incredibly rewarding. As the sole UX/Product Designer, I was able to drive significant design improvements that positively impacted the company's products and user experience. This role not only deepened my design expertise but also prepared me for future challenges in the ever-evolving field of UX and Product Design.</p>\n        </article>\n        <article x-show=\"activeTab === 2\" role=\"tabpanel\" tabindex=\"0\" id=\"tabpanel-2\" aria-labelledby=\"tab-2\">\n            <div>\n                <h2>Key Projects:</h2>\n                <p>One of the most significant projects I worked on was a web-based mobile app called FM:Mobile. The goal was to develop a new modern mobile app to replace a legacy mobile app. Through user research, talking with and visiting maintenance technicians and supervisors, I learned about seeveral pain points within their workflow. Working closely with product management and engineering, I was able to quickly prototype and test potential solutions which led to the design and development of a new mobile solution with offline storage, a new notification system, and improved integration with our desktop-based facilities management product.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"flex\">\n                <img src=\"/assets/images/portfolio/FMS/fm-mobile-offline.png\" class=\"w-1/2\" />\n                <img src=\"/assets/images/portfolio/FMS/fm-mobile-filters.png\" class=\"w-1/2\" />\n            </div>\n        </article>\n    </div>\n\n</div>",

I realized this would be the eighth item in that menu, with several more products slated for addition soon after. Given the menu's current design, these additions would render the navigation unwieldy and user-unfriendly. Recognizing this issue, I proposed to my manager that a comprehensive redesign of the navigation was necessary. I offered to explore redesign options and received approval to proceed.</p>\n        <h2>Task:</h2>\n        <p>My task was to redesign the navigation system for the Customer Portal to accommodate the growing number of product sections while maintaining user-friendliness and efficiency. This involved analyzing the current navigation structure, researching best practices for complex menu systems, and developing a solution that would scale with the addition of new products. I needed to create a design that would improve the user experience while also being technically feasible to implement within our existing framework.</p>\n        <h2>Action:</h2>\n        <p>I began by working closely with our SEO specialist to analyze navigation usage and traffic patterns. I also partnered with product owners to identify areas they deemed most useful for users.</p>\n\n<p>IAfter establishing a baseline for navigation usability, I designed a new navigation structure and information architecture for the Customer Portal. I conducted usability testing sessions with users from across the globe to test and quickly iterate on my proposed changes.</p>\n\n<p>IOnce the design was thoroughly tested and finalized, I collaborated with our development team to implement the new navigation. Simultaneously, I worked with product teams across the organization to redesign their product pages, aiming to better surface information that users were seeking.</p>\n            <h2>Result:</h2>\n            <p>After implementing the new navigation and product pages, I continued to collaborate with our SEO specialist and product owners to monitor the effectiveness of the changes. The improvements I proposed and implemented yielded significant results:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>20% increase in traffic to content</li>\n                <li>Elevated visibility of important content—previously in the bottom 1%—to the top 50 pieces</li>\n                <li>15% increase in time spent on site</li>\n                <li>12% decrease in help requests</li>\n                <li>20% increase in Google indexing due to the architectural changes</li>\n            </ul>\n        </article>\n        <!-- <article x-show=\"activeTab === 2\" role=\"tabpanel\" tabindex=\"0\" id=\"tabpanel-2\" aria-labelledby=\"tab-2\">\n            <div class=\"not-prose\">\n            </div>\n        </article> -->\n    </div>\n\n</div>",
