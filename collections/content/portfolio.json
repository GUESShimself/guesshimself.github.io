This resulted in fragmented user experiences and inefficiencies. With a new initiative to develop an automation platform and customer portal, I joined a small design team tasked with creating a scalable design system to unify the products, improve efficiency, and ensure accessibility.\n\n**Task:**\n\nOur team was responsible for developing a design system that would:\n\n- Create a consistent design language across multiple global products.\n- Improve collaboration between designers and developers in different time zones.\n- Enhance efficiency by minimizing redundant design and development work.\n- Ensure all components met accessibility standards for a user-friendly experience.\n\n**Action:**\n\n1. **Audit and Discovery:**\n    - I conducted a detailed audit of the existing designs to form the foundation of the design system's styles and components.\n    - I worked closely with developers to understand existing frameworks and incorporated their feedback to build a grid system in Adobe XD while documenting component variations for future use.\n2. **Design and Development:**\n    - I helped migrate our design process from Adobe XD to Figma, where I built foundational style libraries and component libraries to improve collaboration and efficiency.\n    - I also translated design styles into Sass files, created documentation to guide developers in integrating components, and worked with the UI development team to integrate our components into Storybook.\n3. **Overcoming Challenges:**\n    - I faced significant issues with conflicting UI libraries used by different development teams. Although I proposed eliminating those libraries to streamline the design system, resource constraints prevented this change.\n    - To bridge the communication gap due to time zone differences, I recorded video walkthroughs of my design decisions and shared them with global teams, allowing them to continue work seamlessly during my offline hours.\n\n**Result:**\n\nThe design system was successfully adopted across the teams, improving collaboration between design and development. The system's components were easy to implement, accessible, and reduced redundant work, earning praise from stakeholders and other teams. Our streamlined process led to a cohesive user experience, while ongoing documentation and communication ensured continuous updates and improvements. Ultimately, the design system transformed the development process, driving more efficient workflows and consistent, high-quality products.\n\n        </article>\n        <article x-show=\"activeTab === 2\" role=\"tabpanel\" tabindex=\"0\" id=\"tabpanel-2\" aria-labelledby=\"tab-2\">\n            <div class=\"not-prose\">\n                <figure class=\"mt-16\">\n                    <figcaption class=\"mb-4 text-base\">Sketching more than just UI flows, I often start my design thoughts on paper.

The opportunity to take full ownership of the design process was a challenge I was eager to tackle. From research and ideation to prototyping and implementation, I was responsible for every stage of product design.</p>\n            <h2>Challenges and Growth:</h2>\n            <p>Working solo meant balancing a wide array of tasks. I had to be not just a designer, but also a researcher, strategist, and sometimes even a project manager. This role pushed me to quickly adapt and learn, ensuring that I could handle the full spectrum of design responsibilities. The autonomy allowed me to refine my decision-making skills and become more resourceful, especially when navigating legacy products and multiple platforms.</p>\n            <h2>Design Process:</h2>\n            <p>My design process was user-centric and iterative. I began with thorough research, conducting user interviews and analyzing feedback to understand pain points and needs. I used these insights to inform my ideation phase, where I created wireframes and user flows using Sketch and Adobe XD. Prototyping was an integral part of my process, allowing me to test and refine designs before final implementation. Collaboration with the development teams was crucial to ensure that the designs were translated effectively into the final products.</p>\n            <h2>Collaboration:</h2>\n            <p>As the only designer, effective communication with other departments was crucial. I regularly collaborated with developers to ensure the feasibility of my designs, and I worked closely with product management to align the product's design with our north star.</p>\n            <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>\n            <p>This experience taught me the importance of flexibility and adaptability. I learned to manage my time effectively, prioritize tasks, and maintain a clear focus on user needs while balancing business goals. The role also strengthened my problem-solving skills, as I often had to find creative solutions to complex design challenges.</p>\n            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n            <p>My time at FM:Systems was incredibly rewarding. As the sole UX/Product Designer, I was able to drive significant design improvements that positively impacted the company's products and user experience. This role not only deepened my design expertise but also prepared me for future challenges in the ever-evolving field of UX and Product Design.</p>\n        </article>\n        <article x-show=\"activeTab === 2\" role=\"tabpanel\" tabindex=\"0\" id=\"tabpanel-2\" aria-labelledby=\"tab-2\">\n            <div>\n                <h2>Key Projects:</h2>\n                <p>One of the most significant projects I worked on was a web-based mobile app called FM:Mobile. The goal was to develop a new modern mobile app to replace a legacy mobile app. Through user research, talking with and visiting maintenance technicians and supervisors, I learned about seeveral pain points within their workflow. Working closely with product management and engineering, I was able to quickly prototype and test potential solutions which led to the design and development of a new mobile solution with offline storage, a new notification system, and improved integration with our desktop-based facilities management product.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"flex\">\n                <img src=\"/assets/images/portfolio/FMS/fm-mobile-offline.png\" class=\"w-1/2\" />\n                <img src=\"/assets/images/portfolio/FMS/fm-mobile-filters.png\" class=\"w-1/2\" />\n            </div>\n        </article>\n    </div>\n\n</div>",
