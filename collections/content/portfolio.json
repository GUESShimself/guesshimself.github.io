I also wrote our foundational CSS, established design standards & front-end guidelines,\n                    and ensured the continued maintenance, evangelism, and success of the design system.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div x-show=\"tab === 'contributions'\">\n            <div class=\"not-prose\">\n                <figure class=\"mt-16\">\n                    <figcaption class=\"mb-4 text-base\">Sketching more than just UI flows, I often start my design thoughts on paper. The below image is my rough sketch of how we would organize and distribute our design system.</figcaption>\n                    <img src=\"/assets/images/portfolio/CAP-DS/cap-ds-api.jpeg\" class=\"shadow\">\n                </figure>\n                <figure class=\"mt-16\">\n                    <figcaption class=\"mb-4 text-base\">Creating annotations within Figma not only help designers and developers understand intended usage and functionality of components, but it also serves as a good double-check on consistency of design decisions.</figcaption>\n                    <img src=\"/assets/images/portfolio/CAP-DS/cap-ds-table-behavior.png\" class=\"shadow\">\n                </figure>\n                <figure class=\"mt-16\">\n                    <figcaption class=\"mb-4 text-base\">In order to help ensure accessibility was built into our components, I documented guidance on various aspects of usability, like keyboard-navigation as seen in the image below.</figcaption>\n                    <img src=\"/assets/images/portfolio/CAP-DS/cap-ds-a11y-pick-list.png\" class=\"shadow\">\n                </figure>\n                <figure class=\"mt-16\">\n                    <figcaption class=\"mb-4 text-base\">While I'm very efficient in both Figma and front-end code, I still find it faster to sketch my ideas out on paper prior to delving into a digital interface.</figcaption>\n                    <img src=\"/assets/images/portfolio/CAP-DS/cap-ds-header.jpeg\" class=\"shadow\">\n                </figure>\n                <figure class=\"mt-16\">\n                    <figcaption class=\"mb-4 text-base\">The humble button component does so much heavy lifting on many UIs. This is typically the first component I create when working on a new design system in order to help solidify initial design decisions like color, typography, spacing, rounded corners, etc, etc.</figcaption>\n                    <img src=\"/assets/images/portfolio/CAP-DS/cap-ds-button.jpg\" class=\"shadow\">\n                </figure>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n</div>",
