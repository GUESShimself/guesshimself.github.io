# Development Rules

## Design Philosophy
- Prioritize systems thinking: look for patterns and reusable solutions over one-off fixes
- Balance flexibility with constraints - establish guardrails that enable controlled customization
- Every design decision should scale and maintain consistency across contexts
- Favor restrained, editorial aesthetics over decorative complexity

## Code & Implementation
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Maintain existing variable font implementation (Fraunces and Inter)
- Keep micro-interactions subtle and purposeful
- Follow established naming conventions and file organization patterns

## Working with AI Assistance
- Present options and trade-offs rather than making decisions for me
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions so I can make informed choices
- Don't assume what's "best" - I want to maintain my design judgment and decision-making skills
- Flag potential issues or considerations, but let me decide the path forward

## Future-Proofing
- Consider how solutions support planned features: blog posts, individual case study pages, and navigation systems
- Keep routing and content structure flexible for growth
- Document architectural decisions that will impact future development
