        <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400 sm:leading-7 lg:leading-8 sm:text-base lg:text-lg mb-2">Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on many diverse, data-driven projects. These include overhauling the information architecture of an award-winning customer support portal, optimizing medical imaging workflows for physicians and technicians, and crafting design systems that enable teams to bring accessible products to market more efficiently.</p>

        <!-- <h2 class="mt-5 mb-2 text-2xl font-bold lg:mt-10 sm:mt-6 dark:text-neutral-200">Career</h2> -->
        <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400 sm:leading-7 lg:leading-8 sm:text-base lg:text-lg mb-2">My skill set spans a broad range, from a deep knowledge of design tools like Figma and expertise in design thinking and design systems, to writing front-end code (HTML/CSS) and utilizing front-end technologies. As tools, trends, and industries evolve, I am continually exploring new methods and engaging in activities that keep my processes productive and efficient.</p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400 sm:leading-7 lg:leading-8 sm:text-base lg:text-lg mb-2">Design is a passion of mine where Iâ€™m able to use my creativity to distill complex and often nebulous ideas into solutions that ultimately help people. The satisfaction of knowing that Iâ€™ve helped bring a solution to fruition, bringing a positive impact business and users is what motivates me the most.</p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400 sm:leading-7 lg:leading-8 sm:text-base lg:text-lg mb-2">Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid disc golfer and love exploring new courses wherever I go. If I was good enough, Iâ€™d make that my profession. Luckily for you and my family, Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m blessed to spend so much of my time with my wife watching our two kids play soccer and supporting our local NWSL team (Go Courage!).</p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400 sm:leading-7 lg:leading-8 sm:text-base lg:text-lg">Looking ahead, Iâ€™m excited to take on new challenges where I can find opportunities to learn and continue my growth as a design leader. Continuing to be an individual contributor is the path that feels right to me, as I get energized by keeping my hands in the day to day operations while keeping an eye on the horizon.</p>
