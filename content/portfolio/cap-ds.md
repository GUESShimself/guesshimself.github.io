                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    A new automation platform and customer portal projects were being kicked off with
                    development teams located across the globe. To streamline development processes and ensure
                    consistency, I joined a small but mighty design team to build and develop the framework with the
                    goal of empowering our teams to develop these new products in an accessible and user-friendly
                    way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our company, serving numerous industries including commercial, government, and
                    transportation, faced significant challenges with inconsistent design practices across different
                    teams. This led to inefficient processes and fragmented user experiences. Our division was
                    tasked with creating a new platform built on new technology to enable engineers to deliver
                    low-code solutions for various customer needs. To address these issues, our design team set out
                    to build a design system to support the quick growth of our new enterprise-level product.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>Establish a consistent design language across these products.</li>
                    <li>Improve collaboration between designers and developers working across global time zones.
                    </li>
                    <li>Enhance efficiency by reducing redundant work.</li>
                    <li>Ensure accessibility standards are met across all components.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                <p>
                    My work spanned nearly all aspects of the design system. I began with UI audits of
                    initial designs and code, then built components in XD before migrating and rebuilding them in
                    Figma. I also wrote our foundational CSS, established design standards & front-end guidelines,
                    and ensured the continued maintenance, evangelism, and success of the design system.
