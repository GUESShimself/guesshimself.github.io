        <h2>Situation:</h2>
        <p>The company, which serves multiple industries like commercial, government, and transportation, faced a major challenge: its products were built by different teams across the globe without a consistent design language. This resulted in fragmented user experiences and inefficiencies. With a new initiative to develop an automation platform and customer portal, I joined a small design team tasked with creating a scalable design system to unify the products, improve efficiency, and ensure accessibility.</p>
        <h2>Task:</h2>
        <p>Our team was responsible for developing a design system that would:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a consistent design language across multiple global products.</li>
            <li>Improve collaboration between designers and developers in different time zones.</li>
            <li>Enhance efficiency by minimizing redundant design and development work.</li>
            <li>Ensure all components met accessibility standards for a user-friendly experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Action:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Audit and Discovery:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I conducted a detailed audit of the existing designs to form the foundation of the design system's styles and components.</li>
                    <li>I worked closely with developers to understand existing frameworks and incorporated their feedback to build components that would help us move away from 3rd party dependencies while documenting component variations for future use.</li>
                    <li>I leveraged resources provided by Brand, Marketing, and other design teams to help align and inform our design team's strategy.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Design and Development:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I helped create and then migrate our design process from Adobe XD to Figma, where I built foundational style libraries, icon libraries, and component libraries to improve collaboration and efficiency.</li>
                    <li>I also translated design styles into Sass files, created documentation to guide developers in integrating components, and worked with the UI development team to integrate our components into Storybook.</li>
                    <li>Working closely with PMs, I spent a portion of my time helping maintain and organizing our product backlogs, assisting with project management duties, and aiding our design and dev teams with scrum master duties.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Overcoming Challenges:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I faced significant issues with conflicting UI libraries used by different development teams. Although I proposed eliminating those libraries to streamline the design system, resource constraints prevented this change.</li>
                    <li>To bridge the communication gap due to time zone differences, I recorded video walkthroughs of my design decisions and shared them with global teams, allowing them to continue work seamlessly during my offline hours.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <h2>Result:</h2>
            <p>The design system was successfully adopted across the teams, improving collaboration between design and development. The system's components were easy to implement, accessible, and reduced redundant work, earning praise from stakeholders and other teams. Our streamlined process led to a cohesive user experience, while ongoing documentation and communication ensured continuous updates and improvements. Ultimately, the design system transformed the development process, driving more efficient workflows and consistent, high-quality products.</p>
