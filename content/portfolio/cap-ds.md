## Project Overview
A new automation platform and customer portal projects were being kicked off with development teams located across the globe. To streamline development processes and ensure consistency, I joined a small but mighty design team to build and develop the framework with the goal of empowering our teams to develop these new products in an accessible and user-friendly way.

Our company, serving numerous industries including commercial, government, and transportation, faced significant challenges with inconsistent design practices across different teams. This led to inefficient processes and fragmented user experiences. Our division was tasked with creating a new platform built on new technology to enable engineers to deliver low-code solutions for various customer needs. To address these issues, our design team set out to build a design system to support the quick growth of our new enterprise-level product.

## Objectives

- Establish a consistent design language across these products.
- Improve collaboration between designers and developers working across global time zones.
- Enhance efficiency by reducing redundant work.
- Ensure accessibility standards are met across all components.

## My Contributions

My work spanned nearly all aspects of the design system. I began with UI audits of initial designs and code, then built components in XD before migrating and rebuilding them in Figma. I also wrote our foundational CSS, established design standards & front-end guidelines, and ensured the continued maintenance, evangelism, and success of the design system.
