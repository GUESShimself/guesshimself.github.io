## Project Overview
As a Sr Product Designer for Conduent, I helped create a new enterprise-level platform that allows engineers to efficiently build low-code solutions for a wide variety of our customers’ automated tasks. Designed in tandem with the CAP Design System, I worked with globally distributed teams to quickly create and validate solutions for our developers and engineers to implement.

## Objectives

- Create design principles for design and dev
- Incorporate and help refine design system usage
- Discover and document design patterns
- Provide flexible and comprehensive design solutions for various business needs

## My Contributions

As the senior designer on the team, my experience working across various types of projects and teams came in handy as I helped maneuver our team through a transition from XD to Figma, backlogs in Axure DevOps, and cross-team communication with a global team of designers, developers, and PMs. As [Brad Frost puts it](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/job-title-its-complicated/), some people are bricks and some are mortar. I’m the mortar.
