            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                As a Sr Product Designer for Conduent, I helped create a new enterprise-level platform that allows engineers to efficiently build low-code solutions for a wide variety of our customers‚Äô automated tasks. Designed in tandem with the CAP Design System, I worked with globally distributed teams to quickly create and validate solutions for our developers and engineers to implement.
            </p>
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Create design principles for design and dev</li>
                <li>Incorporate and help refine design system usage</li>
                <li>Discover and document design patterns</li>
                <li>Provide flexible and comprehensive design solutions for various business needs</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <p>As the senior designer on the team, my experience working across various types of projects and teams came in handy as I helped maneuver our team through a transition from XD to Figma, backlogs in Axure DevOps, and cross-team communication with a global team of designers, developers, and PMs. As Brad Frost puts it, <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/job-title-its-complicated/">some people are bricks and some are mortar</a>. I‚Äôm the mortar.</p>
