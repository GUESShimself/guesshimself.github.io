            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                As a Sr Product Designer for Conduent, I helped create a new enterprise-level platform that allows engineers to efficiently build low-code solutions for a wide variety of our customers‚Äô automated tasks. Designed in tandem with the CAP Design System, I worked with globally distributed teams to quickly create and validate solutions for our developers and engineers to implement.
            </p>
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Create design principles for design and dev</li>
                <li>Incorporate and help refine design system usage</li>
                <li>Discover and document design patterns</li>
                <li>Provide flexible and comprehensive design solutions for various business needs</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <p>As the senior designer on the team, my experience working across various types of projects and teams came in handy as I helped maneuver our team through a transition from XD to Figma, backlogs in Axure DevOps, and cross-team communication with a global team of designers, developers, and PMs. As Brad Frost puts it, <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/job-title-its-complicated/">some people are bricks and some are mortar</a>. I‚Äôm the mortar.</p>

                    <figcaption class="mb-4 text-base">Sketching is an integral part of my design process where I'm able to quickly share and validate ideas. Below is a sketch of providing the ability to search by data types and receiving search results in real time via the dropdown. Sharing a photo of this with product mangement allowed for a quick thumbs-up to move forward with design and development.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption class="mb-4 text-base">One of the most integral areas of the automation platform, the Workflow Builder is a low-code solution to creating custom workflows for a plethora of business needs. I continually iterated on the design and functionality of this part of the product alongside our solution engineers and architects. I created design patterns and built flexible components that allowed for the configuration of wide-ranging business needs.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption class="mb-4 text-base">In order to design the dashboards for our configurable customer-facing products, I created guidelines for color ussage, chart types dependent on data, and layout standards. Those guides helped create consistent and user-friendly experiences while allowing users to access powerful features like filtering and reporting.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption class="mb-4 text-base">User management can become a complex beast, so keeing the user interface simplistic allowed users to easily find the information they need and quickly take action. This was a theme that was carried across the entire product as part of our product design guidelines.</figcaption>
